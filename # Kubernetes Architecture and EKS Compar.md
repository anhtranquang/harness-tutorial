## Introduction (5 minutes)

### Evolution of Container Orchestration
- **Pre-container era**: Traditional VMs and deployment challenges
- **Container revolution**: Docker emerges (2013)
- **Orchestration need**: Managing containers at scale becomes critical
- **Google's influence**: From Borg internally to Kubernetes open-source (2014)
- **CNCF adoption**: Kubernetes becomes the first CNCF project (2015)

### What is Kubernetes?
- An open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications
- Originally designed by Google, now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
- Provides a "container-centric" infrastructure
- Abstracts away the underlying hardware to create a consistent platform
- Often abbreviated as K8s (8 represents the eight letters between 'K' and 's')

### Why Kubernetes Matters
- De facto standard for container orchestration
- Enables consistent deployments across environments
- Provides self-healing capabilities
- Supports declarative configuration and automation
- Offers built-in scalability
- Has a large and active community
- Ecosystem of tools and extensions

### Managed Kubernetes Services
- **Rising complexity**: Operating Kubernetes clusters requires specialized skills
- **Cloud provider solutions**: Managed services emerge to reduce operational burden
- **Examples**: Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
- **Value proposition**: Focus on applications rather than infrastructure management

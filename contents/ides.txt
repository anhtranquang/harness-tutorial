1. Introduction (0:00–0:05)
Image Idea: Kubernetes Logo or Cluster Overview Diagram
Purpose: Set the context by showing the Kubernetes logo or a high-level cluster architecture diagram to introduce Kubernetes as a container orchestration platform.
Description: A simple diagram showing a Kubernetes cluster with control plane and worker nodes, or the official Kubernetes logo.
Source:
Kubernetes Logo: Download the official logo from the Kubernetes website under the "Branding" section. Ensure you follow their usage guidelines.
Cluster Architecture Diagram: Use a reference architecture diagram from Kubernetes.io. For example, the diagram mentioned in the cluster architecture page shows a reference architecture with control plane and nodes.
Alternative: Use a tool like Creately to create a basic cluster diagram showing nodes, pods, and the control plane.

Save the image as kubernetes-cluster-diagram.png in an images/ folder relative to your Markdown file.
2. Kubernetes Resources (0:05–0:25)
Image Idea: Kubernetes Resources Relationship Diagram
Purpose: Visualize how resources like Pods, Deployments, Services, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Volumes, and Ingress interact within a cluster.
Description: A diagram showing relationships, e.g., Pods managed by Deployments, Services exposing Pods, Ingress routing to Services, and StatefulSets with Volumes. This could be a force-directed graph or a flowchart.
Source:
Existing Diagrams: Check learnk8s.io for a downloadable Kubernetes deployment debugging diagram that includes Pods, Deployments, and Services (available in PDF/PNG).
GitHub Repositories: The cloudogu/k8s-diagrams repository on GitHub offers PlantUML-based diagrams for Kubernetes resources. You can clone the repo, generate a diagram (e.g., for Pods or Deployments), and export it as PNG.
Custom Creation: Use Mermaid.js to create a diagram. For example, the sommerit/k8s-to-mermaid script mentioned in X posts can parse YAML files to generate Mermaid class diagrams visualizing resource relationships.
Example Mermaid code for a simple resource relationship:
mermaid

graph TD
    A[Deployment] --> B[Pod]
    B --> C[Service]
    C --> D[Ingress]
    E[ConfigMap] --> B
    F[Secret] --> B
    G[PersistentVolume] --> H[PersistentVolumeClaim]
    H --> B
Render this using the Mermaid Live Editor and export as PNG.
Specific Resource Diagrams:
Deployment + Service: A diagram showing a Deployment managing multiple Pods and a Service exposing them. You can adapt the example from phoenixnap.com for a visual of Pods and Services.
DaemonSet: Illustrate a DaemonSet deploying one Pod per node (e.g., NGINX Ingress Controller). Use a diagram showing nodes with a Pod on each, inspired by Kubernetes.io.
StatefulSet + ConfigMap + Secret + Volume + PV/PVC + Ingress: Create a complex diagram for the Confluence example, showing a StatefulSet pod linked to a ConfigMap, Secret, PersistentVolumeClaim, and Ingress. Use Creately or Miro to draw this, as they support detailed Kubernetes architecture diagrams.

3. Helm Charts (0:25–0:45)
Image Idea: Helm Chart Structure and Deployment Flow
Purpose: Show the anatomy of a Helm chart and how it deploys resources to a Kubernetes cluster.
Description:
Chart Structure: A diagram of the Helm chart folder structure (Chart.yaml, values.yaml, templates/), highlighting how values.yaml customizes templates.
Deployment Flow: A flowchart showing the process of helm install creating a Release, rendering templates, and deploying resources (e.g., Deployment, Service).
Source:
Chart Structure: Create a simple diagram using Draw.io or Miro to visualize the folder structure. Alternatively, check Helm Docs for an official illustration of chart anatomy.
Deployment Flow: Use withcoherence.com for inspiration, as they explain Kubernetes components with flowcharts. Adapt their style to show helm install → Template Rendering → Kubernetes API → Resource Creation.
Existing Visuals: The livewyer.io Kubernetes Glossary includes an illustration of a Helm chart, which you can use as a reference to create a similar image.
Custom Creation:
Use Mermaid.js for a deployment flow:
mermaid

graph LR
    A[Helm Chart] --> B[helm install]
    B --> C[Values.yaml]
    C --> D[Templates]
    D --> E[Kubernetes API]
    E --> F[Deployment]
    E --> G[Service]
Render and export from the Mermaid Live Editor.

4. Live Demo (0:45–0:55)
Image Idea: Screenshot or Diagram of Deployed NGINX Resources
Purpose: Show the output of the Helm demo, such as the NGINX pods and services created.
Description: A screenshot of kubectl get pods,svc output or a diagram of the NGINX Deployment and Service created by the Bitnami NGINX chart.
Source:
Screenshot: Run the demo commands (helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx and kubectl get pods,svc) in your terminal, capture the output using a screenshot tool, and crop it to show the relevant resources.
Diagram: Create a diagram showing the NGINX Deployment (3 replicas) and Service (port 8080) using Draw.io or Eraser.io, which offers an AI Kubernetes diagram generator.
Inspiration: Adapt the deployment diagram from learnk8s.io to show the NGINX-specific setup.
